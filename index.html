<h1>Attention Paper: How Generative AI Reshapes Today's Shadow Industry Ecosystem - Rethinking the Next Generation Risk Management System.</h1>

<p>The rapid development of digital economy has led to the emergence of various black and shadow internet industries, which pose potential risks that can be identified and managed through digital risk management (DRM) that uses different techniques such as  machine learning and deep learning. The evolution of DRM architecture has been driven by changes in data forms. However, the development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology, such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, has given black and shadow industries powerful tools to personalize data and generate realistic images and conversations for fraudulent activities. This poses a challenge for DRM systems to control risks from the source of data generation and to respond quickly to the fast-changing risk environment. This paper aims to provide a technical analysis\footnote{The case studies, comparisons, statistics, research and recommendations in this paper are provided ``as is'' and intended for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as operational, marketing, legal, technical, tax, financial or other advice.} of the challenges and opportunities of AIGC from upstream, midstream, and downstream paths of black/shadow industries and suggest future directions for improving existing risk control systems. The paper will explore the new black and shadow techniques triggered by generative AI technology and provide insights for building the next-generation DRM system.</p>
